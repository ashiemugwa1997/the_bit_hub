## Current Implementation Status

The project has implemented most core functionality including:

- ✅ Complete user authentication system with two-factor authentication
- ✅ Basic cryptocurrency wallet management
- ✅ Market, limit, stop, and recurring order types
- ✅ Asset listing and portfolio tracking
- ✅ Tax reporting and cost basis calculation
- ✅ Crypto-to-crypto conversion functionality
- ✅ News feed integration
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints

Areas still requiring additional development include:

- ⚠️ Real-time price data integration (currently simulated)
- ⚠️ Advanced order matching engine
- ⚠️ Mobile application integration
- ⚠️ Advanced analytics and reporting
- ⚠️ Social trading features

## Security Considerations

The platform implements several key security measures:

1. **Authentication Security**: Two-factor authentication, secure password policies
2. **Data Protection**: Content Security Policy implementation
3. **API Security**: Key-based authentication with IP restrictions
4. **Session Management**: Secure cookie handling and session expiration
5. **Input Validation**: Form validation and CSRF protection
6. **Network Security**: SSL/TLS encryption (when properly deployed)

## Deployment Configuration

The system is currently configured for development but includes preparation for production deployment:

- Development: SQLite database, debug settings enabled
- Production (recommended): PostgreSQL database, Gunicorn WSGI server, Nginx reverse proxy

## Testing Status

The project includes basic testing frameworks but requires more comprehensive test coverage:

- Unit tests for core models
- Integration tests for key workflows
- API endpoint tests

## Documentation

Documentation is provided through:

- Code comments and docstrings
- README installation and configuration instructions
- In-application guides and tutorials
